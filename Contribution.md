## Training 

We're excited to announce that we will be enhancing our training dataset with new video data captured to specifically improve our model's accuracy in detecting subtle eye and head movements. 
By the end of this weekend (04/14/2024), we expect to integrate this new data and begin retraining our model to better serve users with more accurate and responsive interaction capabilities.

Stay tuned for further updates, and as always, we appreciate your continued support and contributions to the Vistra Smart Mirror project!
