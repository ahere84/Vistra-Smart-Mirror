## Features ##
1. Operate the smart mirror without physical touch, using only subtle head and eye movements.
2. Utilizes torchvision library from PyTorch to detect directional gazes such as top left (TL), top right (TR), bottom left (BL), and bottom right (BR).
3. Designed to be used by individuals with varying levels of mobility, enhancing accessibility and ease of use
4. control interface with gaze control

## Installation ##

## Contributing
### Data Contributions
We are actively seeking to expand the `EyeMovementDataset` to enhance the eye-tracking capabilities of Vistra Smart Mirror. More diverse training data can significantly improve the accuracy and responsiveness of our technology. If you are interested in contributing data or improving the dataset, please see the guidelines in `CONTRIBUTING.md` or contact us directly at aheredi7@montgomerycollege.edu.

## Technology
The eye movement detection in Vistra Smart Mirror is powered by a machine learning model trained on a dataset of eye movements. Currently, the dataset requires further expansion to enhance detection accuracy across diverse conditions. We welcome contributions of training data, especially from environments and demographics currently underrepresented in our dataset.
